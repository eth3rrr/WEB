  <p>What is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="blank" title="html5 specification">html</a>? That day, I <strong>slept like a <u>coma</u></strong> <head>LEE <head>
  This was drawn from the complete dump of the Japanese Wikipedia on April 20, 2013 which was run through a morphological analyzer called JUMAN.</p>This is a list of lemmas, not inflected forms, where homographs are counted as a single lemma. The lemma may not be the most common form.
  There are two words appearing twice on the list
  <img src="coding.jpg" width="100%">
  <p style="margin-top:45px;">The 10,000 most frequent words accounted for 92% of all occurrences, the top 5000 accounted for 86%, the top 2000 accounted for 76%, and the top 1000 accounted for 68%.
  In total, nearly 226 million words consisting of just over 163,000 lemmas were counted.</p>
